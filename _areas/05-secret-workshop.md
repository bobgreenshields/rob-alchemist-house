On spotting the party the Rats will grab weapons and immediately raise the alarm.  Doom timer is the Rats from 4 with the Rat Ogre and Packmaster arriving on 5.

The assistants will draw their knives but will not engage.  The Skaven Alchemist uses his warplock pistol, Galkern Tallore will use magic but try to stay close to his escape route through 6.  He will flee at the first sign that the Skaven will be overcome.

If anyone rolls a 1 whilst in reach of the table they will smash glassware on the tabletop initiating the Fireball.
