- title: "Chaos runes"
  desc: |-
    The walls of the small chamber are covered in strange runes either scratched onto the walls or drawn in blood.  The runes are deeply unsettling, disorientating and make your vision swim.  Make a DC 15 Cha save or be Stunned, save ends.

- title: "Bloody floor"
  desc: |-
    The floor is covered in dried blood.  It's clear that it starts below the manacles and drains through a small grill in the floor.  There are lumps of flesh dried in amongst the blood.  It's all humanoid.

- title: "Manacles"
  desc: |-
    The back wall has manacles set into them.  They look very secure and have dried blood on them.

- title: "Small table - silver tools"
  desc: |-
    A small table against the wall supports a set of beautifully crafted silver sacrificial tools.  They all are engraved with chaos runes especially the symbol of Khorne.  A DC 15 Investigation check reveals that the style of making and decoration is identical to the silver items on display at the Temple of Tyr.
